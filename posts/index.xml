      <description>Slices #  Go slices are small constructs backed by a traditional array. The slice construct is light weight because it contains only a pointer to it&amp;rsquo;s first element, a length and a capacity. The slice pointer can point to any element in the backing array.
The length denotes the number of elements currently in the slice and the capactiy denotes the maximum number of elements allowed in the slice. Generally, the capacity of a slice is the size of the underlying array.</description>

      <description>Using an unsigned instead of an int to gain one more bit to represent positive integers is almost never a good idea
 - Bjarne Stroustrup
Default representation #  It&amp;rsquo;s natural to think of integers in terms of signed types because they can represent negative values. In C/C++, integer literals, without any modifiers, are signed types.
If done incorrectly, converting between signed and unsigned integers can be dangerous. Even when done correctly, if the program is working with a value that can&amp;rsquo;t be represented within the bounds of the target signedness the program experiences an error and that error must be dealt with.</description>
